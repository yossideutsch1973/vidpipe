# Loop Examples for VidPipe
# Use {} to create continuous loops

# Basic continuous camera feed
{webcam -> window}

# Continuous edge detection loop (uncomment to use)
# {webcam -> grayscale -> edges -> window}

# Continuous blur effect loop (uncomment to use)  
# {webcam -> blur -> window}

# Complex continuous processing (uncomment to use)
# {webcam -> grayscale -> corners -> window}

# You can also loop simulated feeds (uncomment to use)
# {camera -> grayscale -> window}
