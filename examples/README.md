## How to Run Examples

### Command Line
```bash
# Run a specific example
python3 main.py --cli -f examples/simple.vp

# Run with custom pipeline
python3 main.py --cli -c "webcam -> grayscale -> display"

# Run multi-pipeline file
python3 main.py --multi examples/comprehensive_demo.vp
```

### GUI Mode
```bash
python3 main.py --gui
```
Then:
- Copy and paste any example pipeline into the editor and click "Run Pipeline"
- Or use File â†’ Open Multi-Pipeline... to load multi-pipeline files

## Multi-Pipeline Format

Multi-pipeline files allow you to execute multiple pipelines with timing and parallel execution:

### Sequential Execution with Timing
```python
--pipeline 5s
webcam -> display

--pipeline 10s
webcam -> edges -> display
```

### Parallel Execution
```python
--parallel

--pipeline stream1
webcam -> display with (window_name: "Stream 1")

--pipeline stream2
webcam -> edges -> display with (window_name: "Stream 2")

--end
```

### Syntax Elements
- **`--pipeline [duration]s [name]`** - Define a pipeline with optional duration
- **`--parallel`** - Start parallel execution section
- **`--end`** - End parallel section
- **Duration format**: `5s` (seconds), `10s`, `30s`, etc.
- **Pipeline names**: Optional identifiers for organization

## New Language Features (v0.2.0+)

VidPipe now supports advanced language features for pipeline composition and modularity:

### Pipeline Definitions
Define reusable pipeline components:
```python
pipeline preprocess = webcam -> brightness with (brightness: 20)
pipeline analyze = grayscale -> edges -> contours
```

### Pipeline References
Use defined pipelines as building blocks:
```python
preprocess -> analyze -> display
```

### Timing Control
Execute pipelines for specific durations:
```python
webcam -> display @ 5s          # Run for 5 seconds
preprocess -> analyze @ 10s     # Run analysis for 10 seconds
```

### Parallel Execution
Run multiple pipelines simultaneously:
```python
webcam | edges -> display       # Parallel processing
(preprocess | analyze) -> display  # Parallel with composition
```

### Complex Composition
Combine all features for sophisticated workflows:
```python
# Define components
pipeline prep = webcam -> brightness with (brightness: 20)
pipeline detect = grayscale -> edges
pipeline show = display with (window_name: "Analysis")

# Sequential with timing
prep @ 3s -> detect @ 5s -> show

# Parallel execution
prep | detect -> show

# Nested composition
pipeline full_analysis = prep -> detect
full_analysis @ 8s -> show
```

## Tips for Using Examples

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with `simple.vp` to understand basic pipeline structure
2. **Test Incrementally**: Add one function at a time to understand each processing step
3. **Experiment**: Modify parameters in examples to see how they affect results
4. **Combine**: Mix elements from different examples to create custom pipelines
5. **Debug**: Use test patterns when webcam isn't available for testing

## Common Patterns

### Real-time Processing
```python
webcam -> blur -> edges -> display
```

### Multi-output Processing
```python
webcam -> edges -> (display | record)
```

### Parameterized Processing
```python
webcam -> brightness with (brightness: 30) -> contrast with (contrast: 20) -> display
```

### Parallel Processing
```python
webcam -> (grayscale -> edges | blur | threshold) -> display
```

## Troubleshooting

- **No video display**: Check that camera permissions are granted
- **Performance issues**: Reduce resolution or simplify processing pipeline
- **Parameter errors**: Verify parameter names and value ranges in documentation
- **Recording fails**: Ensure output directory is writable
