## 4. Competitive Landscape

**Direct Competitors:**
- **GStreamer**: Industry standard, pipeline-based, but C-focused and complex syntax
- **OpenCV Python**: Powerful but requires manual threading and pipeline management
- **FFmpeg**: Command-line video processing, limited real-time capabilities
**Adjacent Competitors:**
- **OBS Studio**: User-friendly GUI, focused on streaming/recording, not programmable
- **Node-RED**: Visual flow programming, general-purpose but not video-optimized
- **TouchDesigner**: Node-based visual programming, expensive, creative industry focus
**Emerging Competition:**
- **Browser-based tools**: Online video editors (Canva, etc.) but not real-time/programmable
- **AI Platforms**: RunwayML, Replicate - focus on ML models, not pipeline construction

**Market Position:**
Positioned as a Programmable real-time video processing for developers with unique approach to solving domain-specific challenges.

**Positioning Characteristics:**
- **language_focus**: Python-centric, developer-friendly
- **interface**: Traditional command-line focused
